## Quick Fixes:

  ### -Make sure you have a fully working linux distribution installed, for all functions to work properly you need a _debian_ based distribution. I am still working on the compatibility with _arch_.

  ### -Some tools need an Window Manager
 
  ### -Make sure you have python installed and on the newest version:
  
  Debian:
    
      sudo apt install python3
    
  Arch:
    
      sudo pacman -S python3
    
  Fedora:
     
      sudo dnf install python3

  ### -Some Features need extra programms, those may need to be installed manually
