!!!This Script has Multiple Errors and is in Pre-Alpha Version!!!

Also, I used some code from David Bombal, specifically from his WiFi Deauth Scripts. (https://github.com/davidbombal/red-python-scripts)

How to install this Script?
  Create a new python file and paste the content of main.py.
  Run said file

Quick Fixes:

  -Make sure you have a linux distribution installed, for all functions to work properly you need a debian based distribution.
 
  -Make sure you have python installed:
  
  Debian:
    
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
    
  Arch:
    
      sudo pacman -Syu python3
    
  Fedora:
     
      sudo deb install python3
